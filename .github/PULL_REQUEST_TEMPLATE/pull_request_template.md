***Task Creation***
- [ ]  Check if the task already has an issue created previously
- [ ]  If no previously created issue, Create issue assigned on [Github](http://Github.com),
- [ ]  Using the Github issue template, give a very clear, explicit and explanatory description of the issue, such that any person who is not you can pick the issue and completely understand what needs to be done
- [ ]  Ceate a Card on [Trello](http://trello.com) for the new issue and using the Github powerup, link the issue to the card
- [ ]  Proceed to work on the task

***Task work***
- [ ]  Create a new branch for each applicable issue or issue checklist item
- [ ]  Commit every time any change is made and push to the server immediately. (All *PRs* are squashed, so **do not** worry about the number of commits
- [ ]  When the branch is ready for review, create a Pull request (Using PR template where available)
- [ ]  Attach the PR to your Trello card using the Github powerup
- [ ]  Assign the PR to the necessary party and notify the reviewer
- [ ]  You are responsible for ensuring the reviewer completes the review of the task
- [ ]  **ONLY** ever use your Git UI (e.g GITAHEAD) to **commit** work done
- [ ]  If work is seen to not have been committed with the Git UI, it can be regarded as not done.

***Task review***
- [ ]  To prepare the Pull review for reviewer, take a recording and screenshot of the functionality been added in action
- [ ]  Add said Screenshots and Videos as comments on the Pull request
- [ ]  Absence of the above, means the Pull request is not due for review
- [ ]  For code reviews, note all observations
- [ ]  Differentiate between blocking (Prevent app use) and non-blocking observations
- [ ]  Add blocking observations to PR using `Request changes`
- [ ]  Add non-blocking observations to the Feature optimization issue on Github (Create one, if none exist)
